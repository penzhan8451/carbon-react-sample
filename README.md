# craft-base

A base [Create React App From Template (CRAFT)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/craft-cli) template
for React projects at the IBM Garage.

This template adds additional tools and configuration, but leaves everything generated by CRA
untouched. Even this README will be ignored and replaced by the default from CRA.

## Quick start

To create a project named _my-project_, accessing GitHub Enterprise via SSH (with an SSH key):

```bash
npx -p craft-cli craft my-project git@github.ibm.com:bluemix-garage/craft-base.git
```

Or, via HTTPS (with a password or personal access token):

```bash
npx -p craft-cli craft my-project https://github.ibm.com/bluemix-garage/craft-base.git
```

To begin, you should reformat the generated code with Prettier and commit the change:

```
cd my-project
npm run format
npm run lint
git add . && git commit -m "Apply craft-base and reformat code with prettier"
```

## Details

Added npm packages:

- [prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types): runtime type checking for React props
- [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier): opinionated code formatter
- [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-prettier): Prettier integration for ESLint
- [eslint-config-prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-prettier): ESLint configuration for Prettier

Added npm scripts:

- `npm run lint`: runs ESLint against the code
- `npm run format`: formats the code with Prettier

Added configuration files:

- `.vscode/settings.json`: basic VS Code configuration
- `.eslintrc.json`: ESLint configuration to use Prettier and prop-types
- `.prettierrc`: Prettier configuration (longer line widths)
- `.npmrc`: npm configuration (suppress npm noise when scripts fail)
- `.prettierignore`: files exclude from Prettier formatting
